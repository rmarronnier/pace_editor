# Actual Headless Testing Status

## Current Reality

**ALL specs that use `require "../spec_helper"` open a graphics window** because:
- `spec_helper.cr` loads the entire PACE Editor application
- The application loads `point_click_engine` 
- `point_click_engine` initializes Raylib on load

## Specs That Open Windows (All Current Specs)
- ✗ Core specs
- ✗ Model specs  
- ✗ Validation specs
- ✗ Export specs
- ✗ UI specs
- ✗ "Headless" UI specs

## True Headless Specs
Only specs that don't load the application can run headless:
- ✓ `spec/truly_headless_spec.cr` (created as proof of concept)

## Running Specs

### With Graphics Window
```bash
# This will open a window
crystal spec
```

### Without Graphics Window
```bash
# Only this works truly headless
crystal spec spec/truly_headless_spec.cr
```

## Conclusion

The current codebase architecture makes true headless testing impossible without significant refactoring. The "headless" specs created earlier are misnamed - they still require graphics but test non-drawing logic.

## Recommendations

1. **Accept Current State**: Run all tests with graphics available during development
2. **Future Refactoring**: Consider separating business logic from UI dependencies
3. **CI/CD**: Use a virtual display (like Xvfb) for running tests in CI

### For CI/CD Environments

```bash
# Install virtual display
apt-get install xvfb

# Run tests with virtual display
xvfb-run -a crystal spec
```

This is the standard approach for testing GUI applications in headless environments.
