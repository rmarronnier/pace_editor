## How to Test

### 1. Test Exit Button
```bash
# Run PACE
./pace_editor

# Test exit functionality
1. Click "File" menu
2. Click "Exit" 
# Application should immediately close
```

### 2. Test Character Creation Buttons
```bash
# Run PACE
./pace_editor

# Test character buttons
1. Click "Character" mode button (in menu bar)
2. Look at left tool palette - should show character tools
3. Click "New Char" button
4. Click "Edit Anim" button  
5. Click "Script" button

# Expected console output:
🎭 Creating new character...
   ✓ Character creation dialog would open here
   ✓ This button is working!

🎬 Opening animation editor...
   ✓ Animation timeline would open here

📝 Opening script editor for character...
   ✓ Lua script editor would open here
```

### 3. Test Dialog Tree Buttons
```bash
# Run PACE
./pace_editor

# Test dialog buttons
1. Click "Dialog" mode button (in menu bar)
2. Look at left tool palette - should show dialog tools
3. Click "Add Node" button
4. Click "Connect" button

# Expected console output:
💬 Creating new dialog node...
   ✓ Dialog node creation dialog would open here
   ✓ This button is working!

🔗 Connecting dialog nodes...
   ✓ Node connection tool activated
   ✓ This button is working!
```

### 4. Debug Output to Watch For

If buttons still don't work, you should see debug output like:
```
🔍 Button 'New Char' clicked! (5, 150) hover: true
```

If you DON'T see this debug output when clicking, then there's still a click detection issue.
