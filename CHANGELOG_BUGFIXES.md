- ‚úÖ Verified smooth rendering performance improvements

### üîÑ Migration Notes

#### For Users
- **Character editing workflow changed:** Properties are now edited via the property panel on the right side of the screen, not in the character editor itself
- **Script editing added:** Click "Edit Script" in character editor to open full script editor with syntax highlighting
- **Selection required:** Characters must be selected before their properties can be edited

#### For Developers

- **Viewport updates:** All editor classes now implement `update_viewport` method
- **Scene references:** Use `EditorState.current_scene` instead of `Project.current_scene`
- **Path construction:** Always use `File.join` instead of string concatenation for file paths
