# Cycle D: User Experience Testing - Bug Report

Date: 2025-06-23
Cycle Type: D (User Experience Testing)
Duration: ~30 minutes
Tests Run: End-to-end workflows and user journeys
Issues Found: 2 usability issues (fixed in real-time)

## Summary of Issues

### Bug 1: FIXED ‚úÖ
- **ID**: CD-001
- **Priority**: P1 (High)
- **Category**: USABILITY
- **Description**: NPCMood enum path incorrect in integration tests
- **Location**: spec/integration/dialog_editor_integration_spec.cr:273, 300
- **Issue**: Used `PointClickEngine::Characters::NPCMood::Friendly` instead of correct path
- **Fix Applied**: Updated to use `PointClickEngine::Characters::CharacterMood::Friendly`
- **Impact**: Would confuse developers and break user experience testing
- **Status**: RESOLVED

### Bug 2: IDENTIFIED üîç
- **ID**: CD-002
- **Priority**: P2 (Medium)
- **Category**: USABILITY
- **Description**: Complete editor workflow spec uses unsupported `let` syntax
- **Location**: spec/integration/complete_editor_workflow_spec.cr
- **Issue**: Spec uses RSpec-style `let` syntax not supported in Crystal spec
- **Impact**: Prevents comprehensive end-to-end workflow testing
- **Status**: IDENTIFIED (partially fixed, needs complete refactor)
