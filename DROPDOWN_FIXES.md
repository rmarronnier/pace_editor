# Dropdown Menu Click Fixes

## Problem Fixed
The dropdown menu items were visible but clicking on them didn't work because the menu close logic was too aggressive.

## Solution Applied
1. **Improved Click Detection**: Modified the menu closing logic to be more precise - it now checks if the mouse is within dropdown boundaries before closing
2. **Enhanced Open Project Dialog**: Implemented a proper file browser that scans for .pace files
3. **Better Event Handling**: Dropdowns now stay open when clicking within their bounds

## How to Test the Fixes

### Test New Project Creation
1. **Run PACE**: `./pace_editor`
2. **Click File menu** - dropdown should appear
3. **Click "New Project"** - dialog should open
4. **Type project name** - text should appear with cursor
5. **Click "Create"** - project should be created and dialog closes

### Test Open Project
1. **Click File menu**
2. **Click "Open Project"** - file browser dialog should appear
3. **If .pace files exist** - they should be listed and clickable
4. **If no .pace files** - helpful message should explain what to do

### Test Other Menu Items
1. **Edit menu**: 
   - Click "Undo" (should be grayed out if nothing to undo)
   - Click "Redo" (should be grayed out if nothing to redo)
2. **View menu**: 
   - Click "Show Grid" (should toggle checkmark)
   - Click "Show Hotspots" (should toggle checkmark)
   - Click "Reset Camera" (should execute action)

### Test Menu Behavior
1. **Dropdown stays open** when clicking items within it
2. **Dropdown closes** when clicking outside the dropdown area
3. **Only one dropdown** open at a time
4. **Escape key** closes dialogs

## Expected Console Output

When creating a new project, you should see:
```
Created project: [Project Name]
Project saved to: [Path]
```

When there are errors:
```
Failed to create project: [Error message]
```

## Verification Steps

✅ **New Project Creation**:
1. File → New Project opens dialog
2. Can type in name field 
3. Create button works
4. Project structure is created

✅ **Open Project**:
1. File → Open Project opens file browser
2. Lists existing .pace files
3. Can click on files to load them
4. Shows helpful message if no files found

✅ **Menu Responsiveness**:
1. All dropdown items respond to clicks
2. Menus close properly
3. No interference between different dropdowns

## What's Working Now

- ✅ File menu: New Project, Open Project, Save Project
- ✅ Edit menu: Undo, Redo (with proper enabled/disabled state)
- ✅ View menu: Toggle options with visual checkmarks
- ✅ Help menu: About dialog
- ✅ Proper dropdown click detection
- ✅ Modal dialogs with overlays
- ✅ Text input with visual feedback

The dropdown menus should now be fully functional for creating and loading projects!
