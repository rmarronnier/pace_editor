## How to Create a Game

### Quick Start Guide:

1. **Create a New Project**
   - Run the editor
   - `File → New Project`
   - Enter project name and location

2. **Create Your First Scene**
   - `File → New Scene` (or it's created automatically)
   - Press `B` to set a background image

3. **Add Interactive Elements**
   - Press `P` for Place tool
   - Click in the scene
   - Choose "Hotspot" for interactive areas
   - Choose "Character" for NPCs

4. **Edit Objects**
   - Press `V` for Select tool
   - Click on objects to select them
   - Use Property Panel to edit:
     - Position (X, Y)
     - Size (Width, Height)
     - Description
     - Other properties

5. **Save Your Work**
   - Press `Ctrl+S` to save the current scene
   - Scene is saved as YAML in the project folder

6. **Add Scripts** (Manual for now)
   - Create Lua scripts in `scripts/` folder
   - Name them after your hotspots (e.g., `door.lua`)
   - Add interaction functions:
   ```lua
   function on_click()
       show_message("You clicked the door!")
   end
   ```

## What Still Needs Integration

These features exist in the codebase but need UI integration:

1. **Script Editor** - The script editor UI exists but needs to be connected to hotspots
2. **Dialog Editor** - Visual dialog tree editor needs scene integration  
3. **Animation Editor** - Character animation system needs to be hooked up
4. **Export System** - Game export exists but needs menu integration
5. **Asset Import** - Drag-and-drop or import dialog for assets

## Testing the Editor

Run the comprehensive test to verify everything works:
```bash
crystal spec spec/integration/editor_workflow_spec.cr
```

## Next Steps

The editor is now functional for creating basic adventure games! You can:

1. Create scenes with backgrounds
2. Place interactive hotspots
3. Add characters
4. Edit all properties
5. Save and load your work

To make it more complete, consider:
- Connecting the Script Editor to hotspots
- Adding menu items for missing features
- Creating example projects
- Writing user documentation

The core functionality is solid and working. The editor just needs the remaining UI pieces connected!
