# PACE Editor Compatibility Update - Implementation Status

## Completed Tasks

### âœ… Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Created comprehensive data models matching the new game format:
  - `GameConfig` - Complete game configuration with all nested classes
  - `Quest`, `QuestObjective`, `Reward`, `JournalEntry` - Full quest system
  - `DialogTree`, `DialogNode`, `DialogChoice` - Dialog system
  - `Item`, `ItemState` - Inventory items
  - `Cutscene` with all action types - Cutscene definitions
  - `Condition` and `Effect` - Game logic primitives
- All models include validation methods

### âœ… Phase 2: Validation System
- Created complete validation framework:
  - `ValidationResult` - Unified error/warning reporting
  - `BaseValidator` - Base class with helper methods
  - `GameConfigValidator` - Validates game configuration
  - `AssetValidator` - Validates project assets
  - `ProjectValidator` - Orchestrates all validations
- Validation checks:
  - File existence
  - Format compliance
  - Cross-references
  - Asset paths
  - Identifier formats

### âœ… Phase 3: Export System
- Completely rewrote export functionality:
  - `GameExporter` - New export system with validation
  - Generates proper `game_config.yaml`
  - Creates correct directory structure
  - Copies and organizes assets
  - Generates `main.cr` entry point
  - Creates `shard.yml` for Crystal dependencies
  - Validates before export
  - Returns validation results for UI feedback

## Next Steps

### ðŸ”„ Phase 4: UI Updates (Not Started)
The UI needs to be updated to:
1. Add "Export Game" menu option
2. Show validation results dialog
3. Add game configuration editor
4. Update property panels

### ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Missing Editors (Not Started)
New editors needed for:
1. Quest editor
2. Item editor
3. Cutscene editor
4. Enhanced scene editor features

## How to Use the New Export

The export system is now integrated into the `Project` class. When `export_game` is called:

1. A `GameConfig` is automatically generated from project settings
2. Full validation is performed
3. If validation passes, the game is exported in the new format
4. A `ValidationResult` is returned with any errors/warnings

Example usage:
```crystal
validation_result = project.export_game("/path/to/output.zip")
if validation_result.valid?
  puts "Export successful!"
else
  puts validation_result.to_s
end
```

## Technical Notes

- Models use YAML::Serializable for easy serialization
- Validation is comprehensive but not exhaustive
- Export creates placeholder files for missing components
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing projects
- All paths in exported games are relative for portability

## Testing Recommendations

1. Create a minimal test project with one scene
2. Try exporting and check the generated files
3. Verify the exported game runs in the Point & Click Engine
4. Test validation by introducing errors
5. Check asset organization in exported games
