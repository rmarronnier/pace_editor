## Testing Strategy

The functional workflow tests in `spec/integration/functional_workflow_spec.cr` document these missing features by testing complete user workflows and identifying where functionality is incomplete or missing.

### How to Use This Report

1. **For Developers**: Prioritize implementing features marked as "Critical" first
2. **For Testing**: Run the functional workflow tests to verify current state
3. **For Users**: This explains why certain workflows don't work as expected

### Next Steps

1. ✅ ~~Implement background import dialog~~ - COMPLETED
2. ✅ ~~Add asset import functionality to asset browser~~ - COMPLETED  
3. ✅ ~~Create scene creation wizard~~ - COMPLETED
4. ✅ ~~Implement actual game export functionality~~ - COMPLETED
5. Add visual dialog editor (current priority)
6. Implement missing tools (paint, zoom, delete)

This report should be updated as features are implemented to track progress.
