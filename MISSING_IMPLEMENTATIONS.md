## Next Steps

1. ✅ ~~Start with Scene File I/O implementation~~ - COMPLETED
2. ✅ ~~Implement basic object placement~~ - COMPLETED  
3. ✅ ~~Create simple asset import dialog~~ - COMPLETED
4. ✅ ~~Add minimal undo/redo for moves~~ - COMPLETED
5. ⏳ Test with sample game project - PENDING

## Current Status Summary

**Major accomplishments:**
- ✅ Complete scene serialization/deserialization system with full YAML support
- ✅ Functional hotspot and character placement tools with undo support
- ✅ Asset import system with multi-format support and auto-discovery
- ✅ Full undo/redo functionality for object creation and movement
