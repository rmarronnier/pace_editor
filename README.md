## Upgrading from Previous Versions

If you're upgrading from PACE 1.x, here's what you need to know:

### Breaking Changes
- Export format has changed to match Point & Click Engine v1.0
- Scene files now use the new YAML structure
- Project files remain compatible but export differently

### Migration Steps
1. Open your existing project in PACE 2.0
2. The editor will automatically update internal structures
3. Review any validation warnings
4. Re-export your game using the new export system

### New Requirements
- Exported games now require a `game_config.yaml` file (auto-generated)
- Scene files must include proper navigation data
- Asset paths must follow the new directory structure

For detailed migration instructions, see [Migration Guide](docs/migration/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).
