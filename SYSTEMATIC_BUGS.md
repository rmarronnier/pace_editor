# Systematic Bugs in PACE Editor Codebase - RESOLVED

This document lists systematic bugs and potential issues that were found and **FIXED** in the PACE Editor codebase. All critical issues have been resolved as of the latest update.

## ‚úÖ 1. Resource Leak - Background Textures Never Unloaded (FIXED)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

**Location:** `src/pace_editor/editors/scene_editor.cr` (lines 105-110)

**Original Issue:** Background textures were loaded but never unloaded, causing memory leaks.

**Fix Applied:**
```crystal
# Unload existing texture if any
if old_texture = scene.background
  RL.unload_texture(old_texture)
end
scene.background = texture
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pace_editor/editors/scene_editor.cr` - Added texture cleanup before loading new textures
- `src/pace_editor/ui/background_selector_dialog.cr` - Added texture cleanup when switching backgrounds
- `src/pace_editor/core/editor_state.cr` - Added `cleanup_current_scene` method
- `src/pace_editor/ui/menu_bar.cr` - Added scene cleanup before loading new scenes
- `src/pace_editor/core/editor_window.cr` - Added cleanup on application exit

**Impact:** Memory leaks eliminated, improved stability during scene switching.

## ‚úÖ 2. Duplicate State Management - current_scene (FIXED)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

**Original Issue:** Both `EditorState` and `Project` classes maintained separate `current_scene` properties.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed `current_scene` property from `Project` class
- Updated all references to use `EditorState.current_scene` instead
- Fixed game export dialog and editor window status display

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pace_editor/core/project.cr` - Removed duplicate `current_scene` property
- `src/pace_editor/core/editor_window.cr` - Updated to use EditorState's current_scene
- `src/pace_editor/ui/game_export_dialog.cr` - Updated scene reference

**Impact:** Eliminated state desynchronization, single source of truth for current scene.

## ‚úÖ 3. Unsafe nil Assertion Usage (FIXED)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

**Original Issue:** Multiple `.not_nil!` calls without proper nil checking could cause crashes.

**Fix Applied:**
```crystal
# Before (unsafe):
@current_project.not_nil!.add_scene("main.yml")

# After (safe):
if project = @current_project
  project.add_scene("main.yml")
end
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pace_editor/core/editor_state.cr` - Fixed unsafe nil assertions
- `src/pace_editor/editors/dialog_editor.cr` - Added proper nil checks for dragging operations
- `src/pace_editor/editors/hotspot_editor.cr` - Fixed hotspot creation nil assertions

**Impact:** Eliminated potential crashes, improved application stability.

## ‚úÖ 4. Performance - Object Allocations in Draw Methods (FIXED)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

**Original Issue:** Color objects were being allocated every frame in draw methods.

**Fix Applied:**
- Created centralized `Colors` module with pre-allocated constants
- Replaced all inline `RL::Color.new` calls in draw methods
- Updated multiple UI components to use cached colors

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pace_editor/ui/colors.cr` - **NEW FILE** with pre-allocated color constants
- `src/pace_editor/ui/animation_editor.cr` - Updated to use color constants
- `src/pace_editor/editors/dialog_editor.cr` - Updated to use color constants
- Multiple other UI files updated

**Impact:** Eliminated thousands of allocations per second, improved rendering performance.

## ‚úÖ 5. Missing Viewport Updates on Window Resize (FIXED)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

**Original Issue:** Only scene editor received viewport updates on window resize.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `update_viewport` method to all editor classes
- Updated editor window to call viewport updates on all editors
- Ensured consistent viewport handling across all editors

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pace_editor/editors/character_editor.cr` - Added `update_viewport` method
- `src/pace_editor/editors/hotspot_editor.cr` - Added `update_viewport` method
- `src/pace_editor/editors/dialog_editor.cr` - Added `update_viewport` method
- `src/pace_editor/core/editor_window.cr` - Updated to call all editors

**Impact:** All editors now properly adapt to window resizing.

## ‚úÖ 6. Path Construction Issues (FIXED)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

**Original Issue:** String concatenation with "/" instead of `File.join` caused Windows compatibility issues.

**Fix Applied:**
```crystal
# Before (Windows incompatible):
"backgrounds/#{filename}"

# After (Cross-platform):
File.join("backgrounds", filename)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pace_editor/ui/background_import_dialog.cr` - Fixed path construction
- `src/pace_editor/ui/background_selector_dialog.cr` - Fixed path construction
- `src/pace_editor/editors/scene_editor.cr` - Fixed asset path construction
- `src/pace_editor/export/game_exporter.cr` - Fixed audio asset paths

**Impact:** Improved cross-platform compatibility, works correctly on Windows.

## ‚úÖ 7. Character Editor Field Editing Issues (FIXED)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

**Original Issue:** Character editor showed non-editable property fields, confusing users.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed duplicate non-editable property display
- Added clear instructions directing users to the property panel
- Implemented character selection helper button
- Added full script editor integration with automatic script generation
- Enhanced user guidance and interface organization

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pace_editor/editors/character_editor.cr` - Complete overhaul of property editing interface

**Impact:** Character properties are now fully editable via the property panel, script editing is functional.

## ‚úÖ 8. Hardcoded Window Dimensions (PREVIOUSLY FIXED)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

All UI components now use actual screen dimensions instead of hardcoded constants.
