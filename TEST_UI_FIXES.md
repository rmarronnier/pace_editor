# UI Fixes Applied to PACE Editor

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Non-responsive Menu Bar
**Problem**: Menu items (File, Edit, View) did nothing when clicked.

**Solution**: 
- Added proper dropdown menu functionality
- Implemented File menu with New Project, Open Project, Save Project, Exit
- Implemented Edit menu with Undo, Redo, Delete (with proper enabled/disabled states)
- Implemented View menu with Show Grid, Show Hotspots, Reset Camera toggles

### 2. New Project Dialog Not Functional
**Problem**: New Project dialog appeared but couldn't accept input.

**Solution**:
- Added text input handling for project name and path
- Added visual text input fields with cursor
- Added input validation (Create button only enabled when name is provided)
- Added modal overlay and proper dialog behavior
- Added Escape key handling to close dialog

### 3. Mode Buttons Work But Content Missing
**Problem**: Mode buttons switched modes but didn't show relevant content.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced Property Panel to show mode-specific content
- Scene mode shows scene properties and object counts
- Character mode shows character editor placeholder
- Hotspot mode shows hotspot editor placeholder  
- Dialog mode shows dialog editor placeholder
- Assets mode shows asset browser with category tabs
- Project mode shows project settings

### 4. Tool Palette Buttons Not Functional
**Problem**: Tool buttons had no visual feedback or functionality.

**Solution**:
- Added proper tool selection with visual feedback
- Tools now highlight when selected
- Added mode-specific tool sections that appear based on current mode
- Each tool shows appropriate icon and keyboard shortcut

### 5. Asset Browser Improvements
**Problem**: Asset browser was mostly non-functional.

**Solution**:
- Added category tabs (Backgrounds, Characters, Sounds, Music, Scripts)
- Added asset grid display with thumbnails
- Added import button (placeholder for file dialog)
- Added empty state messaging
- Added proper asset selection

### 6. Scene Hierarchy Enhancements
**Problem**: Scene hierarchy was static and non-interactive.

**Solution**:
- Added expandable/collapsible tree nodes
- Added proper object selection from hierarchy
- Added visual selection highlighting
- Shows hotspots, characters, and objects organized by type

## Testing the Fixes

To test the improvements:

1. **Compile and run PACE**:
   ```bash
   crystal build src/pace_editor.cr
   ./pace_editor
   ```

2. **Test File Menu**:
   - Click "File" to see dropdown
   - Click "New Project" to open dialog
   - Type project name and see it appear
   - Click "Create" when name is filled

3. **Test Mode Switching**:
   - Click different mode buttons (Scene, Character, Hotspot, etc.)
   - Notice Property Panel content changes for each mode
   - In Assets mode, click category tabs

4. **Test View Menu**:
   - Click "View" menu
   - Toggle "Show Grid" and "Show Hotspots" 
   - Notice checkmarks appear/disappear

5. **Test Tool Selection**:
   - Click different tools in tool palette
   - Notice visual highlighting of selected tool
   - Switch modes to see mode-specific tools appear

## Current Limitations

Some features are still placeholders and need full implementation:
- File browser for Open Project
- Actual asset import functionality  
- Real scene editing with object manipulation
- Character animation editing
- Dialog tree visual editor
- Hotspot creation and editing

But the core UI framework is now functional and responsive!
