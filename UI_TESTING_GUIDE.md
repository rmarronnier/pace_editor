## Complete UI Testing Checklist

### Menu Bar Testing
- [ ] File menu opens and shows all items
- [ ] Edit menu shows Undo/Redo (grayed out when not available)
- [ ] View menu shows checkboxes for Grid/Hotspots
- [ ] Help button opens About dialog
- [ ] Mode buttons switch between Scene/Character/Hotspot/Dialog/Assets/Project

### Dialog Testing
- [ ] New Project dialog accepts text input
- [ ] About dialog shows with modal overlay
- [ ] Escape key closes dialogs
- [ ] Click outside closes menus

### Tool Palette Testing
- [ ] Tool buttons highlight when selected
- [ ] Mode-specific tools appear in each mode:
  - Scene mode: Add BG, Add Char, Add Spot
  - Character mode: New Char, Edit Anim, Script
  - Hotspot mode: Rectangle, Circle
  - Dialog mode: Add Node, Connect

### Property Panel Testing
- [ ] Shows different content for each mode
- [ ] Project mode shows project settings
- [ ] Scene mode shows scene information
- [ ] Other modes show appropriate placeholders

### Asset Browser Testing (Assets Mode)
- [ ] Category tabs work (Backgrounds, Characters, etc.)
- [ ] Import button is visible
- [ ] Shows empty state message when no assets

### Visual Feedback Testing
- [ ] Hover effects on buttons and menu items
- [ ] Selected tools show highlighted state
- [ ] Modal overlays darken background
- [ ] Text cursors blink in input fields

## Console Output to Watch For

When testing, you should see console output like:
```
Creating new character...
Opening animation editor...
Opening script editor for character...
```

This confirms the buttons are working even though full functionality isn't implemented yet.

## Known Limitations (Still TODO)

These are placeholders that work but need full implementation:
- File browser for "Open Project"
- Actual asset import functionality
- Real scene editing with object manipulation
- Character animation timeline
- Dialog tree visual editor
- Hotspot creation tools

## If You Still Have Issues

1. **Dropdowns not showing**: Make sure you compiled with the latest changes
2. **Buttons not responding**: Check console for error messages
3. **Text input not working**: Try clicking in the input field first
4. **About dialog not appearing**: Click the "Help" text directly

## Success Criteria

âœ… **All UI elements should now be responsive**
âœ… **Menus should open and close properly**  
âœ… **Dialogs should appear with proper modal overlays**
âœ… **Text input should work with visual feedback**
âœ… **Mode switching should show different content**

The editor should now feel much more interactive and professional!
